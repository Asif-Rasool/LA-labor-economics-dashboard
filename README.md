# Louisiana Labor Force Dashboard

This interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard provides comprehensive insights into **Louisiana's labor market dynamics** by leveraging data from both the [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) and the [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/). The dashboard supports both state-level and county-level (parish) analysis‚Äîoffering detailed visualizations of unemployment, employment, and labor force trends across Louisiana.

## üì¶ Features

- **State-Level Analysis**

  - Compare Louisiana with other states by viewing time-series line charts of unemployment rates and related metrics.
  - Interactive filters to select states, adjust the date range, and visualize comparative trends.
  - Choropleth maps that display state-level unemployment rates for a selected year.

- **County (Parish)-Level Analysis**

  - Visualize parish-level trends in key labor market metrics: _Unemployment Rate_, _Labor Force Size_, _Employment_, and _Unemployment_.
  - Time-series charts to track the evolution of metrics over time.
  - Interactive choropleth maps to explore regional disparities, with options to filter by parish and year.
  - Data tables available for download to support custom analysis.

- **Data Integration & Caching**
  - Efficient use of [Streamlit's caching](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching) to optimize data fetching from both FRED and BLS APIs.
  - Automated data merging through external scripts that compile national and county-level labor statistics.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- economics_dashboard_Heroku.py # Main Streamlit dashboard script
- Scrap BLS website.py # Script to fetch and merge national and county-level labor data from the BLS API
- merged_national_county_1990_2025.csv # Generated dataset (created by scrap_bls_website.py)
- requirements.txt # List of Python dependencies
- Procfile # For Heroku deployment
- README.md # This README file

_Note:_ The \`merged_national_county_1990_2025.csv\` file is generated by the BLS scraping script. Ensure you run that script to obtain the latest data before launching the dashboard.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asif-Rasool/louisiana-labor-force-dashboard.git
   cd louisiana-labor-force-dashboard
   \`\`\`

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.7 (or above) installed, then run:

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

3. **Set Up API Keys:**

   - **FRED API:**  
     Obtain your API key from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), and export it as an environment variable:

     \`\`\`bash
     export FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key_here
     \`\`\`

   - **BLS API:**  
     Update the BLS API key in your configuration file (e.g., in \`.streamlit/secrets.toml\`) as required by the BLS scraping script.

4. **Generate/Update Data:**

   Run the data scraping script to fetch and merge BLS national and county-level labor data:

   \`\`\`bash
   python Scrap\ BLS\ website.py
   \`\`\`

   This will create or update the \`merged_national_county_1990_2025.csv\` file used by the dashboard.

5. **Launch the Dashboard:**

   Start the Streamlit app:

   \`\`\`bash
   streamlit run economics_dashboard_Heroku.py
   \`\`\`

## üìä Data Sources

- [**FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data):**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) Provides state-level unemployment and related labor statistics.
- [**BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics):**](https://www.bls.gov/) Supplies national and county-level data on labor force, employment, and unemployment metrics.

The data is dynamically fetched and merged for interactive visualization and analysis.
